                <h3>About me!</h3>
                <p>For the last decade I have been involved in the electronics side of the security industry
                    building and repairing PCBs, assembling industial grade security cameras and in my current position
                    providing support to other field/installation technicians, operators and getting involved with the 
                    design and QC side of the buisness.

                    <h4>Assembler and installer </h4>
                    <p>Here was the starting point of my career and ultimately where I found my passion for electronics.
                        I was the first full time employee starting at the company and my main role was to soley build 
                        cameras, simply put I would just assemble them like lego when in the warehouse and when complete
                        install them where needed.

                    <h4>Electronics technician</h4>
                    <p>Fast forwarding a bit and the company grew exponentially, our original team of 4 
                        grew to a team of 8, with branches starting in each state. My team/branch was the 
                        central hub for buisness, my role would be to train the new Assemblers and be in control of 
                        shipping the complete cameras to the other states while primarily installation and maintenence focused.    
                    </p>
                    <p>Here the company allowed me to travel Australia installing cameras for our biggest customers, A 
                        notable experiance was installing temporary cameras in Amberly air base having to be escorted by 3 
                        other personnel and having my phone and laptop confiscated.

                        work has me primarily using Linux systems - mostly Ubunutu and Linux Mint.
